# AWS Configuration
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and update with your actual values
# Note: terraform.tfvars is gitignored to prevent committing sensitive data

# AWS region where resources will be created
# Default: us-east-1 (Free Tier eligible)
aws_region = "us-east-1"

# EC2 instance type (must be Free Tier eligible)
# Options: t2.micro (default), t3.micro
instance_type = "t2.micro"

# Path to your SSH public key file
# Generate a key pair if you don't have one:
#   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/meanapp-key
# Then use the public key path:
public_key_path = "~/.ssh/meanapp-key.pub"

# CIDR block allowed for SSH access
# For security, restrict to your IP address:
#   ssh_cidr_block = "YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/32"
# Or allow from anywhere (less secure):
#   ssh_cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
ssh_cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"

# Name tag for the EC2 instance
instance_name = "meanapp-server"

# Availability zone for the subnet
# Must match the region (e.g., us-east-1a for us-east-1)
availability_zone = "us-east-1a"

# AWS Credentials Configuration
# =============================
# Terraform will use AWS credentials from one of these sources (in order):
# 1. Environment variables: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
# 2. AWS credentials file: ~/.aws/credentials
# 3. IAM role (if running on EC2)
#
# To configure using environment variables:
#   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key"
#   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_key"
#
# To configure using AWS CLI:
#   aws configure
#
# NEVER commit AWS credentials to version control!
